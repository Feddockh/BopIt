# BopIt
Bop-It! Project for interactive guitar chord player. This code is designed to be uploaded to the ATMega chip
which will sit on top of a custom PCB. Our system uses a TFT display interface in SPI configuration to display
lyrics and guitar chords from songs and then grades the user based on the accuracy of thier performance. Our
system includes a microphone which reads the sound played by the guitar and performs a frequency analysis in
order to grade the accuracy.Songs are stored on an external SD card in CSV format. A joystick is used to
navigate the user interface.
